# Airbnb Data Visualization Project
This repository contains the code and data for the visualization of Airbnb data in Tasmania, created as part of the final project for course CODE1161 Design Computing.

# Overview
In this project, we utilize Python and Jupyter Notebook to visualize Airbnb data collected from Tasmania. The aim is to provide insights into the availability, pricing, and distribution of Airbnb listings across the region.

# Files
 - presentation.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for data processing, analysis, and visualization. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how the data was analyzed and visualized.
- TAS AirBnB.xlsx: The raw data file containing information about Airbnb listings in Tasmania.
- tasmania.json: JSON file containing geographical data for Tasmania, used for creating maps.
- airbnbs_availability.png: A PNG image file displaying the availability of Airbnb listings in Tasmania.

# How to Use
To explore the visualization and analysis of Airbnb data:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open presentation.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to run the analysis and generate visualizations.
